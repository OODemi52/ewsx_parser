# EasyWorship Scripture Schedule Parser Challenge

## Overview
This project is designed as a learning challenge for software engineers of all kind. The goal is to create an application that allows users to upload message outlines containing Bible verses, which the application should then parse out the verses and structure them into an [EasyWorship](https://www.easyworship.com) schedule file (`.ewsx`) that the user can download and use directly in [EasyWorship](https://www.easyworship.com).

This project was the result of an actual need I, as well as other people in my life had (the best projects and products usually are), and so I have deployed my implementation of this project, and you can find it on the side bar thingy on GitHub, or by just clicking [here](google.com).

## Project Requirements
- **Input File**: Users should be able to upload a file containing message outlines with Bible verses. In this context, a message outline is a document written by a preacher/minister/pastor/bishop/clergy etc. that outlines the message that they will preach about. Sort of like the thing they teach you to do in English classes, that everyone just ignores and jumps to writing the actual paper instead. This outline will have references to Bible verses in a format similar to [`John 3:16`](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A16&version=NIV), [`1Cor13.13`](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2013%3A13&version=NIV), or [`2 Kings 2:23-24`](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%202%3A23-24&version=NIV), and are sometimes accompanied by translation abbreviations such as `AMP`, `NIV`, or `NKJV`. Example outlines are provided in the `data/examples/outlines/` folder.
- **Output File**: The application should generate a valid [EasyWorship](https://www.easyworship.com) schedule file, `.ewsx`, that can be downloaded and loaded into [EasyWorship](https://www.easyworship.com).
- **Parsing**: The application must accurately parse Bible verses from the input file. Parsing is a very well understood problem; one that is fundamental to software engineering, and computer science as a whole. I won't provide any information about how to parse, but if you are looking for a more software focused project to do involving parsing, you should try [Crafting Your Own Interpreter](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html).
- **Validation**: Ensure the generated `.ewsx` file is valid and can be imported into [EasyWorship](https://www.easyworship.com) without errors.
- **Documentation**: Include comprehensive documentation on how to use your application, as well as your thought process and implementation details.
- **Testing**: Ensure your application is thoroughly tested and works as expected. Along with example outlines being provided in the `data/examples/outlines/` folder, there are example `.ewsx` schedule files in the `data/examples/schedules/` that correspond to each outline by name. You can use these to test and compare the `.ewsx` schedules your application generates.
- **No External Dependencies**: The solution should not rely on external APIs, services, or solutions for parsing the scriptures or generating the `.ewsx` schedule files. Not saying that they do existðŸ˜‰ but if they do, don't use them lol. This project is about learning!
- **Compatibility**: The application should be compatible with the latest version of [EasyWorship](https://www.easyworship.com).


## The Challenges
- **No External APIs**: [EasyWorship](https://www.easyworship.com) does not have an API for interacting with its features. This means you will have to figure out how the `.ewsx` schedule file type works on your own. While I don't want to give away any hints, attention to detail and research are key here. [EasyWorship](https://www.easyworship.com) is production software that was intially launched in 2006. That's a long time ago! This means that unlike most project tutorials you'll find online, things may not be so straightforward when coming up with your solution, so you need to test things out and ensure your code works the way you think it works.
- **Parsing Can Be Tricky** - Parsing is somewhat complex and theory-heavy subject that can be difficult to grasp, especially if you are not very familiar with [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/), but is not impossible ( when it comes to writing software virtually (badum-tss) nothing is impossible if you're willing to stare at a screen for long enough). It is also a veeeeeery well documented, analyzed, explained, optimized, tutorial-ized, etc. process, so while it might present you with a challenge, I have faith that you can do it! (see [`Phil 4:13 NKJV`](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%204%3A13&version=NKJV))
- **No Support for ARM**: [EasyWorship](https://www.easyworship.com) is a very beloved software to me, but it is an old piece of software and the client base is not really young and hip kids that complete projects they read about on Github in their free time. The [EasyWorship](https://www.easyworship.com) software is only currently being supported on devices on toting [x86 or x86-64](https://support.easyworship.com/support/discussions/topics/24000017633) architecture on Windows machines. If you don't know the difference between ARM and x86 architectures, or even why the word "architecture" is being used in a project that supposed to be about programming, it's worth a quick read, and will probably help you understand your machine a little better. With the growing popularity of the ARM architecture, this means that you won't be able to run the [EasyWorship](https://www.easyworship.com) software on your spec'd out [$8000 M4 Max Macbook Pro](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch-space-black-standard-display-apple-m4-max-with-16-core-cpu-and-40-core-gpu-48gb-memory-1tb#) (if you're feeling generous, just max out the specs at checkout for me and I'll let you know where to send itðŸ¥¹) or your shiny new [ThinkPad](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadp/thinkpad-p1-gen-7-16-inch-intel/21kv001cus?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F&cid=us:sem%7Cse%7Cgoogle%7Cp_series_intel%7Cgs_notebooks%7C%7C21KV001CUS%7C6548549653%7C76751676937%7Cpla-2380496801910%7Cshopping%7C&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADnnO-U_55XXkT7DaNHyB2yaHZ_ns&gclid=CjwKCAiAw5W-BhAhEiwApv4goMAJmm9cZ0fm63blr1DxFriq49kOt0iBWm_9NlmpclhSIJ_8CwxooRoC7VIQAvD_BwE) that you immediately flashed [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) onto because all the [cracked](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Cracked) Twitter micro-celebrities keep posting about it to boost their engagement. But not to worry, I have built and hosted a virtual machine running Windows with the EasyWorship software installed for you to use in this project. There, you can try out the software as well as test to see if the  `.ewsx` schedule files your app makes work. You can find it here: [VeeasyWorship](www.google.com)

## Implementation Details
- **Language Agnostic**: Write this project in whatever language you feel like. You can choose your favorite language, use this as opportunity to learn a new one, or even mix them together. The problem this project solves should be agnostic to your implementation, meaning that the user should not have to worry or care how your app works - as long as it actually works. So any language(s) you decide to use, from Ada to Zig (I promise these are real programming languages, and not made up words), are fine with me!
- **Full End-to-End Solution**: Users should be able to upload a file and receive a working [EasyWorship](https://www.easyworship.com) `.ewsx` schedule file in return, with no additional steps required on their end. How that's implemented is solely up to you.
- **Scriptures Tab Only**: This project focuses only on the Scriptures tab of EasyWorship. No songs, presentations, or other media elements should be included. If you're unfamiliar with it, then looks like you have some research to do! (Hint: play around with [EasyWorship](https://www.easyworship.com) here: LINK TO HOSTED VM RUNNING EASYWORSHIP)
- **Documentation and Testing**: Developers should document their thought process and implementation details to help others learn from their approach.
- **Version Control**: Try to maintain healthy [Git Hygiene](https://dzone.com/articles/developer-git-commit-hygiene-1). This is an important skill to have as a software engineer, and if you end up messing up any part of your application, you'll thank yourself if you are able to go back to a version that works. Sometimes `Ctrl-Z` is not enough! 

## âœ¨Bonus Pointsâœ¨:
  - Develop a  [Well-Designed UI](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/ui-design-for-developers/) for users to interact with. This is your chance to show me (and any recruiters looking at your resume ðŸ‘€) not only that you know how to type some keys on a keyboard, but also that you care about the experience that your user/customer has when using the software that you have created.
  - Try hosting the application online so others can use it without local setup. This will look good on your portfolio, but if you do make sure you set your server up properly. You need to take a lot of things into consideration, but here are what I consider to be among the most important:
    - **Security** - Users will be using your application and uploading their data to it. Make sure that it is secure as you can possibly make it. If you aren't well versed in information security already, or even if you are, this is a great opportunity do some research into [Web Security Principles](https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/intro_to_first_principles/README/) and [API Security Best Practices](https://sandydev.medium.com/6-best-practices-for-securing-backend-apis-from-common-vulnerabilities-a-comprehensive-2023-guide-cd15d5225b1f)

    -  **Validation** - This also falls under security, but is about the security of you own application. Anything that is accepted by your server should be checked and verified that it is what it says it is. Notice that I mentioned that an outline is a document, but I didn't specify what type of file one should/can be. That's up to you and the use case you attempt to address with your app implementation. But whatever file types you accept, you prooobbably want to check and make sure it is that file type, that is [Validate Your Input](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html).
    
    - **Abuse** - Unlike what we are all definitely taught while growing up, not everyone on the internet is a good, trustworthy person, who would never act maliciously toward you. Shocking! creating an application of any sorts comes with the inherent risk of someone abusing that software. This can manifest in the form of an end user clicking a button 100 times because they are impatient, someone DDOSing your sever because they're your sworn enemy, or simply because you wrote a while loop and didn't provide a exit condition, and now that [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) function you wrote has been called one thousand times in the past minute. It's very important to set up safeguards to avoid abuse, malicious or otherwise, in your application. I again do not want to give too much input in your implementation of the project, but [Rate Limiting](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-rate-limiting/#:~:text=Rate%20limiting%20is%20a%20strategy,reduce%20strain%20on%20web%20servers.), [Authentication](https://dev.to/ma7moud3bas/how-to-secure-the-web-a-comprehensive-guide-to-authentication-strategies-for-developers-48od), and [Proxying](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/prevent-ddos-attacks/baseline/proxy-dns-records/) are examples of some of the ways you can mitigate the risk of [API Abuse](). Again, I do not want to hijack your learning experience, but the [Cloudflare Free Tier](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/free/) offers some services that would be a good starting point for securing your application, regardless of what platform you choose to host your application on.
    
    - **Server Cost** - *** ***IF YOU DON'T READ ANY OTHER OF THE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS, READ THIS ONE*** ***. Hosting platforms and server providers come in all shapes and sizes. In the effort to give you as much agency as possible in this project, I am fighting every urge to suggest what platforms I would personally recommend you to use. But which ever you do end up using, and I can't stress this enough, **UNDERSTAND HOW THE PRICING WORKS!!!** You can find many [Horror Stories](https://cybernews.com/news/ddos-attack-104k-bill-from-hosting-provider/) of engineers waking up to find out the website the innocently hosted on the platform of their choosing's free tier, has magically generated a humongous bill for them overnight. Most, if not all, hosting service providers have ways for you to either limit how much you can spend, or monitor how much your bill at the end of the month will be and set alerts when the amount goes past a certain threshold (but if you're smart, or âœ¨ *financially challenged*âœ¨ like I am at the moment, you'll figure out a way to host it for $Free.99).

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository and [create a new git branch](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_branch.asp?remote=github) for yourself to develop your application in.
2. Develop your solution to parse Bible verses from message outlines and convert them into an `.ewsx` schedule file.
3. Document your process, including any challenges and how you solved them. You never know who you might end up helping!
     - If you complete a working solution, consider hosting it online for others to use.

### Testing in EasyWorship
Since [EasyWorship](https://www.easyworship.com) does not support ARM or non-Windows machines, testing can be a challenge unless you have a computer that meets the criteria (I say this as someone who does not have a computer that meets that criteria. To address this, I will develop and host an application that will allow you to play around and use your schedule file in the [EasyWorship](https://www.easyworship.com) software online. Stay tuned!

### Submit Your Solution
You can submit your solution for others to see. As an engineer, you have to be both confident in your work but also willing to accept your wrong or don't know something (it will be like this for as long as you live - engineers are life long learners!). If I have time, I might even try and review your solution

4. [Switch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout) to the `solutions` Git branch.
5. Submit a pull request to the `solutions` branch.


## Final Considerations
### Embrace The Struggle
You will probably struggle with this project, and depending on who you are and what you hope to get from completing this project, that might be okay. If you're looking for a quick and easy project to fluff your portfolio, **this might not be the one for you**. There is *intentionally* no guide for this, no tutorial, and it is a project based on software that is not popular, so there is not much written about it. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a bit more of a challenge, want to learn more, improve/sharpen your skills, or are just someone that really likes EasyWorship, then you've come to the right place! **You will still struggle** but that process of struggling through the problem is **CRUCIAL** to learning deeply.

### 
Listen - I can't tell you how to live your life, especially not through a computer screen, but I sure can try: This challenge is meant to test ***your*** skills and help you grow as an engineer. While generative "AI" tools like ChatGPT and Copilot can be useful in many areas, relying on them too much â€” especially when learning â€” can be counterproductive.

"AI" doesnâ€™t ***truly*** understand code, or really [Anything](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/large-language-models-do-understand-anything-here-why-ter-danielyan-djube) for that matter; it **predicts patterns** based on existing data. The [Cognitive Offload](https://watchsound.medium.com/from-learned-dependence-to-learned-helplessness-effects-of-cognitive-offloading-in-the-ai-era-e0bc63b41dbe) performed when using Generative "AI" tools for something like programming often leads to atrophy of your skills and can cause you to develop a sense of learned helplessness overtime. It can generate plausible-looking but incorrect solutions, introduce subtle errors, and hinder the development of critical debugging and problem-solving skills. More and more developers are finding that heavy reliance on "AI" diminishes their ability to code independently, making it harder to remember what they learned and troubleshoot effectively.

If you still decide to use "AI" to solve this challenge, I urge you to be mindful of your use of it, validate what its suggesting to you against real world facts, and still try to do things that frustrate you on your own.

To get the most out of this challenge, try solving the problems yourself. Struggle a little (or a lot), read documentation, and manually debug errors â€” itâ€™s all part of the learning process. Youâ€™ll come out of it a stronger engineer!
